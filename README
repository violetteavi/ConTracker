Welcome to ConTracker, the app that tracks monetary donations to candidate by
state and party using the Federal Election Commision's open source data API.
Specifically, stage one will break down how much money went to Democratic or
Republicans in each of the fifty states.

The technologies to be used in this project include:
Python
FEC API at https://www.fec.gov/data/advanced/
D3js at https://d3js.org/
simple-https-server.py at https://gist.github.com/dergachev/7028596
